This program displays an interactive menu that allows the user to generate different screen-art patterns using nested loops.

The user can choose from:


Rectangle

Reverse Right Triangle

Reverse Stair Step


Each pattern is built using characters printed through loop structures.


Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Loop control structures (for, while, nested loops)

- Conditional logic (if / switch)

- User input handling (via Scanner)

- ASCII text-based shape generation
