# Even Percentage Calculator 

## Overview
This program calculates the **percentage of even numbers** in an integer array entered by the user.  
It repeatedly allows the user to create new arrays, computes the percentage of even values, and displays the result formatted to two decimal places.

---

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Creating and using **methods with array parameters**
- Looping until the user chooses to stop
- Basic array processing (counting even numbers)
- Input validation for empty arrays
- Returning computed values from methods
- Formatting decimal output (`%.2f`)
- Using loops to allow repeated program execution

## Sample Output

```text
Enter the number of elements in the array: 5
Enter the elements of the array:
Element 1: 6
Element 2: 2
Element 3: 9
Element 4: 1
Element 5: 3
Percentage of even numbers: 40.00%

Would you like to enter a new array? (yes/no): yes

Enter the number of elements in the array: 4
Enter the elements of the array:
Element 1: 1
Element 2: 3
Element 3: 5
Element 4: 7
Percentage of even numbers: 0.00%

Would you like to enter a new array? (yes/no): yes

Enter the number of elements in the array: 4
Enter the elements of the array:
Element 1: 2
Element 2: 4
Element 3: 6
Element 4: 8
Percentage of even numbers: 100.00%

Would you like to enter a new array? (yes/no): yes

Enter the number of elements in the array: 0
Enter the elements of the array:
Percentage of even numbers: 0.00%

Would you like to enter a new array? (yes/no): no
