# Minimum & Maximum of Three Integers 

This program prompts the user to enter **three integers** and determines both the **smallest** and **largest** values using conditional statements. The goal is to practice logical comparisons without using built-in helper methods such as `Math.min()` or `Math.max()`.

---

## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to strengthen your understanding of:

- Multi-value comparison using nested `if–else` statements  
- Logical decision-making in Java  
- Handling user input with the `Scanner` class  
- Producing clear and readable console output

## Sample Output

```text

Enter three integers:  12 15 7
The minimum number is: 7

Enter three integers: -12 2 -7
The minimum number is: -12

Enter three integers: 7 7 7
The minimum number is: 7
