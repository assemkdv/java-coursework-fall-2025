# Integer Condition Evaluator 

This program reads an integer from the user and evaluates it against **three independent conditions** using `if–else` statements. Each condition produces a separate output. The program also demonstrates input handling with Java’s `Scanner` class.

## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to practice:

- Writing conditional logic using `if–else` statements  
- Working with integer evaluation  
- Handling user input/output  
- Applying modulus operations to inspect digits  
- Producing clear, structured console output

## Sample Output

```text

Please enter an integer to evaluate: 1234
1234 is a Positive Number 
1234 is a NOT a ODD Number 
No, last digit is not 7 in: 1234

Please enter an integer to evaluate: -4567
-4567 is NOT a Positive Number 
-4567 is a ODD Number 
Yes, last digit is 7 in: -4567

Please enter an integer to evaluate: -0
0 is NOT a Positive Number 
0 is a NOT a ODD Number 
No, last digit is not 7 in: 0
