# EBook Library Application  

## Overview
This project implements a simple **EBook Library management system** using **classes**, **arrays**, **methods**, and **menu-driven interaction**.  
The application allows the user to:

- View detailed information about any EBook in the library  
- Update the price of an EBook  
- Navigate menus with validation and repeat logic  
- Exit gracefully at any time  

The program demonstrates object-oriented programming fundamentals, including class design, encapsulation, arrays of objects, method usage, and controlled program flow.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Arrays of objects

- Menu-driven programs

- Input validation

- Methods for modular functionality

- Loops & control flow
