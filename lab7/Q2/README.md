# Custom Power Method

## Overview
The purpose of this lab is to practice **writing custom methods** and performing mathematical operations **without relying on built-in Java library functions**.

In this assignment, the program prompts the user to enter:
- a **positive real number** (base), and  
- an **integer** (exponent).

The program then computes the value of  
\[
a^n
\]  
by calling a custom method **`power(a, n)`** that performs the calculation manually using **loops**, instead of using `Math.pow()`.

---

## Objective
- Practice designing and implementing **static methods** with parameters and return values.  
- Strengthen understanding of **loops** to perform repeated multiplication.  
- Handle **special exponent cases** (negative numbers, zero).  
- Reinforce accurate user input handling using the **Scanner** class.  
- Build a deeper understanding of how exponentiation works internally.

## Sample Output

```text

Enter the base (a positive real number): 
2
Enter the exponent (an integer): 
4
The result of 2.0 raised to the power of 4 is: 16.0

Enter the base (a positive real number): 
2
Enter the exponent (an integer): 
-4
The result of 2.0 raised to the power of -4 is: 0.0625
