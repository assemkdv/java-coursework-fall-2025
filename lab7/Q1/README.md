# Distance Between Two Points

## Overview
The purpose of this lab is to practice **writing and calling methods in Java**.  
This program reads four real numbers that represent the Cartesian coordinates of two points:  
- Point 1: (x₁, y₁)  
- Point 2: (x₂, y₂)

The program then computes the distance between these two points by calling a custom method named **`distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**, which uses the standard distance formula:

\[
\text{distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

The result is printed to the user.

## Objective
- Practice defining and calling **static methods** in Java.  
- Use **Math.sqrt()** and **Math.pow()** to compute mathematical expressions.  
- Strengthen understanding of method parameters and return values.  
- Work with user input using the **Scanner** class.  
- Apply the distance formula accurately in a Java program.

## Sample Output

```text

Enter x1: 
1
Enter y1: 
2
Enter x2: 
4
Enter y2: 
6
The distance between the points is: 5.0

Enter x1: 
-1
Enter y1: 
-2
Enter x2: 
-4
Enter y2: 
-6
The distance between the points is: 5.0
