# Turtle Class — Shell Strength Management

---

## Overview
In this assignment, you are given a main program (`TurtleAge.java`) that interacts with a `Turtle` object. Your task is to **complete the Turtle class** by implementing methods that allow:

- setting the turtle's shell strength,  
- getting the shell strength,  
- and printing the turtle’s overall information.

The completed class should properly store:
- the turtle’s **age**,  
- the **original shell strength**, and  
- the **current shell strength**, which is adjusted by the main program.

The goal is to practice writing basic **classes**, **setters/getters**, and **output methods** in Java.

---

## Objective
- Practice defining a **custom class** with private attributes.  
- Implement **setter** and **getter** methods for encapsulation.  
- Format output neatly via a `printInfo()` or similar method.  
- Strengthen understanding of how a main program interacts with an object through its methods.

## Sample Output

```text

Enter Turtle's Age: 
50
Enter Turtle's Shell Strength: 
100

Turtle Information:
Age: 50
Original Shell Strength: 100
Current Shell Strength: 8
