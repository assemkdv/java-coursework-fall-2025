# Array Forward & Backward Display

---

## Overview
This program practices creating arrays, handling user input, and printing stored values in different traversal orders.  
The user specifies how many integers they want to enter, the program stores each value in an array, and then displays:

- The integers in **forward order** (the order entered)
- The integers in **backward order** (reverse order)

This assignment reinforces understanding of arrays, loops, and indexing in Java.

---

## Objectives
- Practice creating arrays with user-defined sizes.  
- Store and retrieve user input values.  
- Use loops to print array elements in **forward** and **backward** order.  
- Strengthen understanding of indexing and array traversal.

## Sample Output

```text

Enter the number of integers you want to input: 5
Enter the integers: 
Integer 1: 10
Integer 2: 20
Integer 3: 30
Integer 4: 40
Integer 5: 50
Integers in forward order: 10 20 30 40 50 
Integers in backward order: 50 40 30 20 10
