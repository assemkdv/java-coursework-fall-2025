## Overview
This program prompts the user to enter two integers, **A** and **B**, and prints all numbers from A to B *inclusive*.  
The direction of printing depends on the comparison between A and B:

- If **A < B**, the program prints numbers in **ascending order**.
- If **A ≥ B**, the program prints numbers in **descending order**.

This assignment practices using for-loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

---

## Objective
- Use a **for loop** to iterate through a numeric range.
- Apply **conditional logic** to determine loop direction.
- Read user input using the **Scanner** class.
- Print numeric sequences correctly, including both endpoints.

## Sample Output
``` text

Enter the first integer (A): 3
Enter the second integer (B): 8
3 4 5 6 7 8

Enter the first integer (A): 10
Enter the second integer (B): 5
10 9 8 7 6 5
