### Sum of Even Numbers Program

## Overview  
This program prompts the user to enter a positive integer **n** and then calculates the sum of all even numbers from **1** to **n** (inclusive).  
Using a **for loop** and an **if statement**, the program checks each number in the range and adds only even values to the running total.  
The final result is then printed to the console.

This lab reinforces the use of:
- looping structures (`for`)
- conditional logic (`if`)
- arithmetic operators
- user input using `Scanner`

---

## Objective
- Practice using **for loops** to iterate over a range of numbers.
- Apply conditional checks to filter **even** numbers using the modulo operator `%`.
- Correctly accumulate values inside a loop.
- Strengthen understanding of input/output handling in Java.
- Demonstrate proper commenting and readable code structure.

## Sample Output

```text

Sample 1:
Enter a positive integer (n): 7
The sum of even numbers from 1 to 7 is: 12
 
Sample 2:
Enter a positive integer (n): 3
The sum of even numbers from 1 to 3 is: 2

Sample 3:
Enter a positive integer (n): 1
The sum of even numbers from 1 to 1 is: 0
